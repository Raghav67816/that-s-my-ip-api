## Development Environment

This API uses Python 3 packages listed in requirements.txt located in config directory of the project.
Using virtual environment is recommended. It also uses IP2Location LITE Database downloadable from https://bit.ly/3S1ilvG.

NOTE: You have to download D11 database. I have not included it here because of it's big size. However, after installing move that BIN file namely IP2LOCATION-LITE-DB11.IPV6.BIN to config directory.
